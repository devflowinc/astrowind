# Boosting in Trieve

One of Trieve's most underlooked functionalities is boosting. It's one of the many tools search engineers and stakeholders use to improve results. We've picked up where traditional search systems leave off with additional thought about this increasingly demanding generation of users and businesses.

This is not to be confused with dynamically promoting results by attributes like popularity, recency, membership in collections, or other types of tags typically found in metadata. You can do this with Trieve too.

## What this looks like in practice

For the sake of example let's say that I'm trying to analyze the company behind $YEXT. I don't know anything about it, but I download the 10-K and other documents to start feeling it out. I realize quickly that I need to know about their **growth plans**.

Good search should make this type of analysis easier. For someone that knows what they're looking for, search is a much better tool than RAG. Quality search is sharpened steel in the hands of a master. 
 
For the query *growth plans*, the first few results returned are pretty useless. The first result outlines their unsteadily decreasing growth rate.

![yext coping about the macro, but hey I get it](https://trieve.b-cdn.net/blog/boosting-in-trieve/yext-but-the-macro.png)

This tells me nothing about their growth plans! How do we fix this?

  Trieve's native scraping enables you to boost titles. It works super well. For more on how to use it, check this guide out. Scraping does not work for PDFs yet.

## How do you fix this cherrypicked example?

Let's explode the problem out with this diagram. We have our query, *growth plans*, and chunks getting returned by decreasing score. 

**Chunk #4** is the chunk I need to be returned as the most relevant chunk. Fixing this not only fixes search for this query, but also improves my retrieval for RAG and recommendations by the way!

![search problem diagram](https://trieve.b-cdn.net/blog/boosting-in-trieve/boost-problem-exploded-diagram.png)

Note: We have a heading-based chunker that's better suited for stuff like this.

To fix, we navigate to the Trieve Search Playground to get under the hood. I put our target query, then, I click the "edit chunk" button and expand advanced options. Like this:

![boosting-chunk-in-trieve-gif](https://trieve.b-cdn.net/blog/boosting-in-trieve/boosting-chunk-in-trieve.gif)

Once you expand "advanced options" you'll see fields for boosting. The boost phrase is typically the query that you want to optimize, **growth plans** in our case.

<TextBoxLearnMore>
  FAQ: **If the boost phrase is part of a larger query, like "revenue growth plans for the future" will this chunk be boosted too?** Yes, as long as every single token (which is a word, kinda) is present. 
</TextBoxLearnMore>

**Boost terms** multiplicatively increase the presence of terms in the fulltext document frequency index by the **boost value**.

If you want the chunk to increase in score, thus move up the ranking, then enter a positive number greater than 1. *We've found 1.3 to be a good value to start with.*

If you want that chunk to decrease in score, thus move down the ranking, then enter a number below 1.

And now we've won. **Chunk #4 is now chunk #1 for query growth plan**. We've got the chunk we need, we can analyze and keep the flow up. The first and second order effects of bad search will not affect our work today.

## Why should I care about boosting?

Boosting can be useful in various business scenarios where you want to fine-tune search results.

#### Ecommerce

**Positive**: Products containing "apple" (e.g., Apple devices)

**Negative**: Downrank results related to apple pies, fruit, etc. This helps prioritize tech products over food items when searching for "apple".

#### Technical documentation search:

**Positive**: Documents about Apple software or hardware

**Negative**: Reduce relevance of unrelated documents mentioning apples.

#### News article search

**Positive**: Articles about Apple Inc.

**Negative**: Reduce prominence of articles about apple farming or recipes.

#### Job search platforms

**Positive**: Job listings containing "Apple" (the 3T company)

**Negative**: Downrank listings mentioning apple orchards or food industry jobs

And so on.

## Why Trieve boosting stands out

It must be said that Trieve is built developer-first. What takes a few more fields and many more indices with Solr-based solutions is done within a single Trieve API call. The *ergonomics* are superior.

![fulltext-boosting-api-reference](https://trieve.b-cdn.net/blog/boosting-in-trieve/fulltext-boosting-api-reference.png)

Even with experimental approaches like ColPali, you're stuck with siloing a critical part of your pipeline. With Trieve, you can take full control, experiment, and tweak *if needed* throughout the lifetime of your product.
