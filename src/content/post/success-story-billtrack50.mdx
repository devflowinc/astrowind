## AI Goals

One of the core experiences to the BillTrack50 platform is to discover and track bills relevant to their interests. With thousands, sometimes tens of thousands of bills to discover, organizations were spendings countless hours per year manually querying for bills related to theirs. Not to mention the anxiety of being unsure one has discovered all of the relevant bills and that one has not slipped past their filters and keywords. 

Simply put, there are ways to write legislation about 'gun control' or 'abortion' without the bill actually containing these words. Vectors can be very powerful here. The goal was to create an 'easy button' for users to find bills similar to a given piece of legislation.

## Results

With most of the support being done over email, it took the team one sprint to build, test, evaluate the Trieve-based solution against others, and deploy it to a smaller group of customers. After a successful trial period, it was immediately well-recieved by greater userbase.

We are grateful to the BillTrack50 team and their users for informing critical development and hitting our service with frequency. Trieve is proud to work with such a cornerstone company and excited to see what they build next.
