## About Mintlify

Mintlify is the modern standard for documentation. With its developer-forward product, they make it easy to build beautiful documentation whether you're a large enterprise or just getting started. They've also just raised a Series A and are looking for top-notch talent. If you're in the market, check out out their [careers page](https://mintlify.com/careers). 

Trieve itself is a proud Mintlify customer: checkout the [docs](https://docs.trieve.ai) here.

After reaching out and discussing their technical requirements and desired outcomes for search and RAG, we engaged to power and support the team's ambitious build.

## Building, Evaluating, and Implementing

We first built a [proof-of-concept](https://mintlify.trieve.ai) for the Mintlify team to evaluate the out-of-the-box search quality of Trieve. After drawing out an implementation and proof schedule, it took the team one sprint to build, test, evaluate the Trieve-based solution against others, and deploy it to a smaller group of customers.

After a successful testing period, large-scale search improvements [launched](https://mintlify.com/blog/launch-week-3-day-2) as part of Mintlify's Summer launch week.

Once they established their ingest pipeline with Trieve, integrating search and RAG chat into their product became seamless by design. As an all-in-one solution. Since then, they have successfully rolled out analytics for almost all Mintlify sites!

  text="Once we had our ingest pipeline into Trieve set up, it was so easy to integrate both search & RAG chat into our product -- just a fetch request or two for each! Additionally, the Trieve team shipped features we needed to give our customers a super polished experience extremely fast, most of the time with just a day or two of turnaround!
  Because Trieve is an all-in-one solution, control over chunking, highlighting, and analytics give the team extra levers and knobs to ensure customer satisfaction. Since then, Trieve-powered RAG has been rolled out as well."
